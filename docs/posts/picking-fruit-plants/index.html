<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>So you want to grow some fruit trees in a small space or piece of land. No matter how little room you have, there is always some space for some plants in your garden, so let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<h1 id="tips-and-tricks-for-growing-fruit-trees-in-a-small-garden">Tips and tricks for growing fruit trees in a small garden</h1>
<p>0-  Seeds or Seedlings</p>
<p>Deciding whether you will start your garden from seeds or seedlings or even maturing perennials is essential. There are cons and pros with picking each of these options. If you have a relatively short growing season, it is a good practice to start with well-grown seedlings so you could be way ahead in terms of time. On the other hand, working with seeds instead of growing plants is much cheaper than buying seedlings. If you pick seeds, you need to designate a protected and controlled area to grow them in the initial phases. In this case, there is always a big chance of overplanting, so we may need to thin out our plants in the end.  Starting with seeds is an excellent way of learning about growth habits and get into a regular plant care routine.
A more expensive way to start your garden is to start with perennials bought from a plant nursery. They may be more costly, but they save a lot in time and effort at the beginning of your journey.</p>
<p>1- Climate</p>
<p>One of the most important factors we need to consider before choosing a plant is the climate. It is a well-known fact that individual trees can only grow in certain climate conditions.  For example, the Japanese plum tree can tolerate a relatively low environment where the lowest temperature is about minus 20 to -15 degrees Fahrenheit. Another example is evergreen trees like oranges and lemons. They are susceptible plants that have specific temperature requirements. Their best temperature tolerance ranges from 55 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Their lower limit of temperature in the winter is at least 35 degrees Fahrenheit. 
One of the things that are affected by climate is the amount of sunlight available to the trees. Ideally, most of the fruit trees need hours of exposure to sunlight every day. For instance, fig-trees usually need a sunny place in your garden where they can receive full sun. Fruit trees need as much sunlight as they can get in to produce the most generous amount of fruit; (say a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of sun exposure is required).
Another climate-dependent factor is humidity. When we want to pick our trees, we need humidity-resistant plants. For example, fruits, such as cherry and peaches, are highly susceptible to wet conditions and can develop many fungal diseases.</p>
<p>2- Pollination</p>
<p>The majority of fruit-bearing trees need some method of pollination. Pollination is usually accomplished by insects such as bees to get fertilized.  On some occasions, fruit trees need more than one type of tree to cross-pollinate. They are called self-unfruitful trees. For example,  a pear tree usually requires cross-pollinating with another pear tree.
It puts pressure on your garden in terms of space, so you should consider it when you do not have the luxury of having multiple types of a self-unfruitful tree. Keep in mind that for having a fruit tree, we usually need pollination.</p>
<p>One of the most straightforward solutions in a small garden space is to purchase fruit trees that are &lsquo;self-fertile&rsquo; or &lsquo;self-pollinating.&rsquo;  Some examples are citrus, figs, and peaches. You can also buy some multi-grafted trees such as lemon, orange, and mandarin on the one tree that are self-pollinating.</p>
<p>3- Size matters</p>
<p>After a couple of years and reaching their mature height, many trees will be relatively tall. Most fruit trees usually reach a mature height of at least 4.5 meters if not pruned. In extreme cases, trees can be much more towering. For example, the average English walnut tree reaches a height of 80 feet (25 meters) in its maturity. In a relatively small garden, most of us wouldn&rsquo;t have room for more than a few little trees. If we want to grow some trees that turn into giants after 2-3 years in our garden, we need to be ready to do a lot of pruning or think twice.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s your solution? Dwarf fruit trees! These are grafted onto roots from a related species – a shorter, more compact fruit tree &lsquo;cousin&rsquo;!  So dwarf fruit trees grow in less space and to a lower height than if they grew on their own roots.</p>
<p>Compact dwarf fruit trees offer you a number of benefits:</p>
<pre><code>They don't need much pruning;
Often fruit in under two years;
The fruit are the same size as regular fruit trees;
Multi-grafted fruit trees grow several different fruits on the one tree, saving space;
Are more suitable for balconies, containers and espaliering in narrow spaces;
Are easier to net (to protect against birds and animals); and
Are much easier to access for harvesting – no ladders!

<p>Some dwarf rootstock offer you other advantages, like being resistant to disease; suited to wet or dry soils; strong vigorous growth; or ability to withstand winds.
4. Growing Fruit Trees in Containers</p>
<p>You may be thinking of growing a fruit tree in a container, rather than a garden due to space limitations or because you are renting. If so, there are other things to consider such as:</p>
<pre><code>The size of the pot will limit the growth of your fruit tree.
You will need to re-pot into a larger container as the tree grows, probably at least every 18 months – 2 years.
The shape of container should make it easy to remove your tree.  Grow bags and fabric Smart Pots are a couple of solutions. Only choose pots that have straight sides or taper in towards the bottom for easy removal.
Many pots (especially unfired clay) and potting mix dry out quickly. So consider a low-maintenance drip watering system like EasiOyYa to keep moisture up to your potted fruit tree.
