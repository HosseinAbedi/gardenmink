<p>So you want to grow some fruit trees in a small space or piece of land. No matter how little room you have, there is always some space for some plants in your garden, so let&rsquo;s begin.</p>
<h3 id="seeds-or-seedlings">Seeds or Seedlings</h3>

<p>Deciding whether you will start your garden from seeds or seedlings or even maturing perennials is essential. There are cons and pros with picking each of these options. If you have a relatively short growing season, it is a good practice to start with well-grown seedlings so you could be way ahead in terms of time. On the other hand, working with seeds instead of growing plants is much cheaper than buying seedlings. If you pick seeds, you need to designate a protected and controlled area to grow them in the initial phases. In this case, there is always a big chance of overplanting, so we may need to thin out our plants in the end.  Starting with seeds is an excellent way of learning about growth habits and get into a regular plant care routine.
A more expensive way to start your garden is to start with perennials bought from a plant nursery. They may be more costly, but they save a lot in time and effort at the beginning of your journey.</p>
<h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>

<p>Climate is the average atmospheric conditions in a region over a relatively long span of time. There are lots of different types of climates on Earth. The climate types can be categorized into five kinds:
Tropical: Hot and humid region around the equator with the annual average temperatures usually greater than 64°F (18°C) with relatively high precipitation.
Dry: In this zone, we have little precipitation with a high degree of evaporation hence the name dry.
Temperate: In this type of zone, we typically experience warm and humid summers with thunderstorms along with mild winters.
Continental: Regions with warm to cool summers and icy winters.
Polar:  Extremely cold zones. Even in summer, the temperatures here never go higher than a few degrees centigrade!</p>
<p>One of the most important factors we need to consider before choosing a plant is the climate. It is a well-known fact that individual trees can only grow in certain climate conditions.  For example, the Japanese plum tree can tolerate a relatively low environment where the lowest temperature is about minus 20 to -15 degrees Fahrenheit. Another example is evergreen trees like oranges and lemons. They are susceptible plants that have specific temperature requirements. Their best temperature tolerance ranges from 55 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Their lower limit of temperature in the winter is at least 35 degrees Fahrenheit. 
One of the things that are affected by climate is the amount of sunlight available to the trees. Ideally, most of the fruit trees need hours of exposure to sunlight every day. For instance, fig-trees usually need a sunny place in your garden where they can receive full sun. Fruit trees need as much sunlight as they can get in to produce the most generous amount of fruit; (say a minimum of 6 to 8 hours of sun exposure is required).
Another climate-dependent factor is humidity. When we want to pick our trees, we need humidity-resistant plants. For example, fruits, such as cherry and peaches, are highly susceptible to wet conditions and can develop many fungal diseases.</p>
<h3 id="pollination">Pollination</h3>

<p>The majority of fruit-bearing trees need some method of pollination. Pollination is usually accomplished by insects such as bees to get fertilized.  On some occasions, fruit trees need more than one type of tree to cross-pollinate. They are called self-unfruitful trees. For example,  a pear tree usually requires cross-pollinating with another pear tree.
It puts pressure on your garden in terms of space, so you should consider it when you do not have the luxury of having multiple types of a self-unfruitful tree. Keep in mind that for having a fruit tree, we usually need pollination.</p>
<p>One of the most straightforward solutions in a small garden space is to purchase fruit trees that are &lsquo;self-fertile&rsquo; or &lsquo;self-pollinating.&rsquo; Some examples are citrus, figs, and peaches. You can also buy some multi-grafted trees such as lemon, orange, and mandarin on the one tree that are self-pollinating.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>

<p>After a couple of years and reaching their mature height, many trees will be relatively tall. Most fruit trees usually reach a mature height of at least 4.5 meters if not pruned. In extreme cases, trees can be much more towering. For example, the average English walnut tree reaches a height of 80 feet (25 meters) in its maturity. In a relatively small garden, most of us wouldn&rsquo;t have room for more than a few little trees. If we want to grow some trees that turn into giants after 2-3 years in our garden, we need to be ready to do a lot of pruning or think twice.</p>
<p>There are a couple of solutions to keep your trees in a relatively small space. You can use dwarf fruit trees. They are the result of grafting fruit trees onto smaller related species. Dwarf fruit trees usually need less room to grow. Another solution is to use containers along with dwarf trees. In this case, a dwarf fruit tree is planted into a box filled with fertile soil. Containers make it easy to move the trees and keep the size of the trees small, and their growth is limited to the size of the box.  Of course, there are some cons associated with growing trees in containers, such as the need for changing the pot every now and then (usually every two years).</p>

<p>These trees can be considered the smallest of all fruit trees; at scarcely 45-60cm in height, these are one tier espaliers that are low enough to &lsquo;step over&rsquo; where necessary. Ideal for covering a border or lawn for ornamental uses or dividing the vegetable or flower garden. The crops aren&rsquo;t massive by usual standards, but the fruits can be pretty large. They can also be grown in pots and containers very quickly and need very little room and effort to maintain.</p></div>
